.SH "NAME"
intro \- Introduction to the Cygwin API
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fICygwin\fR
is a Linux\-like environment for Windows\&. It consists of two parts:
.PP
A DLL (cygwin1\&.dll) which acts as a POSIX API emulation layer providing substantial POSIX API functionality, modelled after the GNU/Linux operating system\&. This page describes the API provided by the DLL\&.
.PP
A collection of tools which provide Linux look and feel\&. This environment is described in the
\fBintro\fR(1)
man page\&.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
\fICygwin\fR
is developed by volunteers collaborating over the Internet\&. It is distributed through the website
\m[blue]\fB\%http://cygwin.com\fR\m[]\&. The website has extensive documentation, including FAQ, User\*(Aqs Guide, and API Reference\&. It should be considered the authoritative source of information\&. The source code, released under the
\fIGNU General Public License, Version 3 (GPLv3+)\fR
and
\fILesser GNU General Public License, Version 3 (LGPLv3+)\fR, is also available from the website or one of the mirrors\&.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
\fICygwin\fR
policy is to attempt to adhere to
\fIPOSIX\&.1\-2008/SUSv4\fR
(Portable Operating System Interface for UNIX / The Single UNIX Specification, Version 4) where possible\&.
.PP
\fISUSv4\fR
is available online at:
.PP
\m[blue]\fB\%http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/\fR\m[]
.PP
For compatibility information about specific functions, see the API Reference at:
.PP
\m[blue]\fB\%http://cygwin.com/cygwin-api/cygwin-api.html\fR\m[]
.PP
Where these standards are ambiguous, Cygwin tries to mimic
\fILinux\fR\&. However,
\fICygwin\fR
uses
\fInewlib\fR
instead of
\fIglibc\fR
as its C Library, available at:
.PP
\m[blue]\fB\%https://sourceware.org/newlib/\fR\m[]
.PP
Keep in mind that there are many underlying differences between UNIX and Win32 making complete compatibility an ongoing challenge\&.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.PP
If you find a bug in
\fICygwin\fR, please read
.PP
\m[blue]\fB\%http://cygwin.com/bugs.html\fR\m[]
.PP
and follow the instructions for reporting found there\&. If you are able to track down the source of the bug and can provide a fix, there are instructions for contributing patches at:
