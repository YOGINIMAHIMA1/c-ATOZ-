.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBps\fR
program gives the status of all the Cygwin processes running on the system (ps = "process status")\&. Due to the limitations of simulating a POSIX environment under Windows, there is little information to give\&.
.PP
The PID column is the process ID you need to give to the
\fBkill\fR
command\&. The PPID is the parent process ID, and PGID is the process group ID\&. The WINPID column is the process ID displayed by NT\*(Aqs Task Manager program\&. The TTY column gives which pseudo\-terminal a process is running on, or a
\*(Aq?\*(Aq
for services\&. The UID column shows which user owns each process\&. STIME is the time the process was started, and COMMAND gives the name of the program running\&. Listings may also have a status flag in column zero;
S
means stopped or suspended (in other words, in the background),
I
means waiting for input or interactive (foreground), and
O
means waiting to output\&.
.PP
By default,
\fBps\fR
will only show processes owned by the current user\&. With either the
\-a
or
\-e
option, all user\*(Aqs processes (and system processes) are listed\&. There are historical UNIX reasons for the synonomous options, which are functionally identical\&. The
\-f
option outputs a "full" listing with usernames for UIDs\&. The
\-l
option is the default display mode, showing a "long" listing with all the above columns\&. The other display option is
\-s, which outputs a shorter listing of just PID, TTY, STIME, and COMMAND\&. The
\-u
option allows you to show only processes owned by a specific user\&. The
\-p
option allows you to show information for only the process with the specified PID\&. The
\-W
option causes
\fBps\fR
show non\-Cygwin Windows processes as well as Cygwin processes\&. The WINPID is also the PID, and they can be killed with the Cygwin
\fBkill\fR
command\*(Aqs
\-f
option\&.
