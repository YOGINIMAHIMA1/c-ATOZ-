User operations:
  \-l, \-\-lock               lock USER\*(Aqs account\&.

  \-C, \-\-can\-change         USER can change password\&.
  \-e, \-\-never\-expires      USER\*(Aqs password never expires\&.
  \-E, \-\-expires            USER\*(Aqs password expires according to system\*(Aqs
                           password aging rule\&.
  \-p, \-\-pwd\-not\-required   no password required for USER\&.
  \-P, \-\-pwd\-required       password is required for USER\&.
  \-R, \-\-reg\-store\-pwd      enter password to store it in the registry for
                           later usage by services to be able to switch
                           to this user context with network credentials\&.

System operations:
  \-i, \-\-inactive NUM       set NUM of days before inactive accounts are disabled
                           (inactive accounts are those with expired passwords)\&.
  \-n, \-\-minage MINDAYS     set system minimum password age to MINDAYS days\&.
  \-x, \-\-maxage MAXDAYS     set system maximum password age to MAXDAYS days\&.
  \-L, \-\-length LEN         set system minimum password length to LEN\&.

Other options:
  \-d, \-\-logonserver SERVER connect to SERVER (e\&.g\&. domain controller)\&.
                           Usually not required\&.
  \-S, \-\-status             display password status for USER (locked, expired,
                           etc\&.) plus global system password settings\&.
  \-h, \-\-help               output usage information and exit\&.
  \-V, \-\-version            output version information and exit\&.

If no option is given, change USER\*(Aqs password\&.  If no user name is given,
operate on current user\&.  System operations must not be mixed with user
operations\&.  Don\*(Aqt specify a USER when triggering a system operation\&.

Don\*(Aqt specify a user or any other option together with the \-R option\&.
Non\-Admin users can only store their password if cygserver is running\&.
Note that storing even obfuscated passwords in the registry is not overly
secure\&.  Use this feature only if the machine is adequately locked down\&.
Don\*(Aqt use this feature if you don\*(Aqt need network access within a remote
session\&.  You can delete your stored password by using `passwd \-R\*(Aq and
specifying an empty password\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpasswd\fR
changes passwords for user accounts\&. A normal user may only change the password for their own account, but administrators may change passwords on any account\&.
\fBpasswd\fR
also changes account information, such as password expiry dates and intervals\&.
.PP
For password changes, the user is first prompted for their old password, if one is present\&. This password is then encrypted and compared against the stored password\&. The user has only one chance to enter the correct password\&. The administrators are permitted to bypass this step so that forgotten passwords may be changed\&.
.PP
The user is then prompted for a replacement password\&.
\fBpasswd\fR
will prompt twice for this replacement and compare the second entry against the first\&. Both entries are required to match in order for the password to be changed\&.
.PP
After the password has been entered, password aging information is checked to see if the user is permitted to change their password at this time\&. If not,
\fBpasswd\fR
refuses to change the password and exits\&.
.PP
To get current password status information, use the
\-S
option\&. Administrators can use
\fBpasswd\fR
to perform several account maintenance functions (users may perform some of these functions on their own accounts)\&. Accounts may be locked with the
\-l
flag and unlocked with the
\-u
flag\&. Similarly,
\-c
disables a user\*(Aqs ability to change passwords, and
\-C
allows a user to change passwords\&. For password expiry, the
\-e
option disables expiration, while the
\-E
option causes the password to expire according to the system\*(Aqs normal aging rules\&. Use
\-p
to disable the password requirement for a user, or
\-P
to require a password\&.
.PP
Administrators can also use
\fBpasswd\fR
to change system\-wide password expiry and length requirements with the
\-i,
\-n,
\-x, and
\-L
options\&. The
\-i
option is used to disable an account after the password has been expired for a number of days\&. After a user account has had an expired password for
\fINUM\fR
days, the user may no longer sign on to the account\&. The
\-n
option is used to set the minimum number of days before a password may be changed\&. The user will not be permitted to change the password until
\fIMINDAYS\fR
days have elapsed\&. The
\-x
option is used to set the maximum number of days a password remains valid\&. After
\fIMAXDAYS\fR
days, the password is required to be changed\&. Allowed values for the above options are 0 to 999\&. The
\-L
option sets the minimum length of allowed passwords for users who don\*(Aqt belong to the administrators group to
\fILEN\fR
characters\&. Allowed values for the minimum password length are 0 to 14\&. In any of the above cases, a value of 0 means `no restrictions\*(Aq\&.
.PP
All operations affecting the current user are by default run against the logon server of the current user (taken from the environment variable
\fBLOGONSERVER\fR\&. When password or account information of other users should be changed, the logon server is evaluated automatically\&. In rare cases, it might be necessary to switch to another domain controller to perform the action\&. In this case, use the
\-d
option to specify the machine to run the command against\&. Note that the current user must have account operator permissions to perform user account changes in a domain\&.
.PP
Users can use the
\fBpasswd \-R\fR
to enter a password which then gets stored in a special area of the registry on the local system, which is also used by Windows to store passwords of accounts running Windows services\&. When a privileged Cygwin application calls the
\fBset{e}uid(user_id)\fR
system call, Cygwin checks if a password for that user has been stored in this registry area\&. If so, it uses this password to switch to this user account using that password\&. This allows you to logon through, for instance,
\fBssh\fR
with public key authentication and get a full qualified user token with all credentials for network access\&. However, the method has some drawbacks security\-wise\&. This is explained in more detail in
the section called \(lqPOSIX accounts, permission, and security\(rq\&.
.PP
Please note that storing passwords in that registry area is a privileged operation which only administrative accounts are allowed to do\&. Administrators can enter the password for other user accounts into the registry by specifying the username on the commandline\&. If normal, non\-admin users should be allowed to enter their passwords using
\fBpasswd \-R\fR, it\*(Aqs required to run
\fBcygserver\fR
as a service under the LocalSystem account before running
\fBpasswd \-R\fR\&. This only affects storing passwords\&. Using passwords in privileged processes does not require
\fBcygserver\fR
to run\&.
.PP
Limitations: Users may not be able to change their password on some systems\&.
