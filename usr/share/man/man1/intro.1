.SH "NAME"
intro \- Introduction to the Cygwin Environment
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fICygwin\fR
is a Linux\-like environment for Windows\&. It consists of two parts:
.PP
A DLL (cygwin1\&.dll) which acts as a POSIX API emulation layer providing substantial POSIX API functionality, modelled after the GNU/Linux operating system\&. The
\fBintro\fR(3)
man page gives an introduction to this API\&.
.PP
A collection of tools which provide Linux look and feel\&. This man page describes the user environment\&.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
\fICygwin\fR
is developed by volunteers collaborating over the Internet\&. It is distributed through the website
\m[blue]\fB\%http://cygwin.com\fR\m[], where you can find extensive documentation, including FAQ, User\*(Aqs Guide, and API Reference\&. The
\fICygwin\fR
website should be considered the authoritative source of information\&. The source code, released under the
\fIGNU General Public License, Version 3 (GPLv3+)\fR
and
\fILesser GNU General Public License, Version 3 (LGPLv3+)\fR, is also available from the website or one of the mirrors\&.
.SH "COMPATIBILITY"
.PP
\fICygwin\fR
uses the GNU versions of many of the standard UNIX command\-line utilities (\fBsed\fR,
\fBawk\fR, etc\&.), so the user environment is more similar to a Linux system than, for example, Sun Solaris\&.
.PP
The default login shell and
\fB/bin/sh\fR
for
\fICygwin\fR
is
\fBbash\fR, the GNU "Bourne\-Again Shell", but other shells such as
\fBtcsh\fR
(an improved
\fBcsh\fR) are also available and can be installed using
\fICygwin\fR\*(Aqs setup\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
To port applications you will need to install the development tools, which you can do by selecting
gcc
in
\fIsetup\&.exe\fR
(dependencies are automatically handled)\&. If you need a specific program or library, you can search for a
\fICygwin\fR
package containing it at:
.PP
\m[blue]\fB\%http://cygwin.com/packages/\fR\m[]
.PP
If you are a UNIX veteran who plans to use
\fICygwin\fR
extensively, you will probably find it worth your while to learn to use
\fICygwin\fR\-specific tools that provide a UNIX\-like interface to common operations\&. For example,
\fBcygpath\fR
converts between UNIX and Win32\-style pathnames\&. The full documentation for these utilities is at:
.PP
\m[blue]\fB\%http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html\fR\m[]
.PP
The optional
cygutils
and
cygutils\-extra
packages also contain utilities that help with common problems\&.
.SH "DOCUMENTATION"
.PP
In addition to man pages and texinfo documentation, many
\fICygwin\fR
packages provide system\-independent documentation in the
/usr/share/doc/
directory and
\fICygwin\fR\-specific documentation in
/usr/share/doc/Cygwin/
.PP
For example, if you have both
\fBless\fR
and
\fBcron\fR
installed, the command
\fBless /usr/share/doc/Cygwin/cron\&.README\fR
would display the instructions to set up
\fBcron\fR
on your system\&.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
.PP
If you find a bug in
\fICygwin\fR, please read
.PP
\m[blue]\fB\%http://cygwin.com/bugs.html\fR\m[]
.PP
and follow the instructions for reporting found there\&. If you are able to track down the source of the bug and can provide a fix, there are instructions for contributing patches at:
.PP
\m[blue]\fB\%http://cygwin.com/contrib.html\fR\m[]
