.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmount\fR
program is used to map your drives and shares onto Cygwin\*(Aqs simulated POSIX directory tree, much like as is done by mount commands on typical UNIX systems\&. However, in contrast to mount points given in
/etc/fstab, mount points created or changed with
\fBmount\fR
are not persistent\&. They disappear immediately after the last process of the current user exited\&. Please see
the section called \(lqThe Cygwin Mount Table\(rq
for more information on the concepts behind the Cygwin POSIX file system and strategies for using mounts\&. To remove mounts temporarily, use
\fBumount\fR
.SS "Using mount"
.PP
If you just type
\fBmount\fR
with no parameters, it will display the current mount table for you\&.
.PP
\fBExample\ \&3.10.\ \&Displaying the current set of mount points\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBmount\fR
C:/cygwin/bin on /usr/bin type ntfs (binary)
C:/cygwin/lib on /usr/lib type ntfs (binary)
C:/cygwin on / type ntfs (binary)
C: on /mnt/c type ntfs (binary,user,noumount)
D: on /mnt/d type fat (binary,user,noumount)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In this example, c:/cygwin is the POSIX root and the D drive is mapped to
/mnt/d\&. Note that in this case, the root mount is a system\-wide mount point that is visible to all users running Cygwin programs, whereas the
/mnt/d
mount is only visible to the current user\&.
.PP
The
\fBmount\fR
utility is also the mechanism for adding new mounts to the mount table in memory\&. The following example demonstrates how to mount the directory
//pollux/home/joe/data
to
/data
for the duration of the current session\&.
.PP
\fBExample\ \&3.11.\ \&Adding mount points\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBls /data\fR
ls: /data: No such file or directory
$ \fBmount //pollux/home/joe/data /data\fR
mount: warning \- /data does not exist!
$ \fBmount\fR
//pollux/home/joe/data on /data type smbfs (binary)
C:/cygwin/bin on /usr/bin type ntfs (binary)
C:/cygwin/lib on /usr/lib type ntfs (binary)
C:/cygwin on / type ntfs (binary)
C: on /c type ntfs (binary,user,noumount)
D: on /d type fat (binary,user,noumount)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
A given POSIX path may only exist once in the mount table\&. Attempts to replace the mount will fail with a busy error\&. The
\-f
(force) option causes the old mount to be silently replaced with the new one, provided the old mount point was a user mount point\&. It\*(Aqs not valid to replace system\-wide mount points\&. Additionally, the
\-f
option will silence warnings about the non\-existence of directories at the Win32 path location\&.
.PP
The
\-o
option is the method via which various options about the mount point may be recorded\&. The following options are available (note that most of the options are duplicates of other mount flags):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
  acl        \- Use the filesystem\*(Aqs access control lists (ACLs) to
               implement real POSIX permissions (default)\&.
  binary     \- Files default to binary mode (default)\&.
  bind       \- Allows to remount part of the file hierarchy somewhere else\&.
               Different from other mount calls, the first argument
               specifies an absolute POSIX path, rather than a Win32 path\&.
               This POSIX path is remounted to the POSIX path specified as
               the second parameter\&.  The conversion to a Win32 path is done
               within Cygwin immediately at the time of the call\&.  Note that
               symlinks are ignored while performing this path conversion\&.
  cygexec    \- Treat all files below mount point as cygwin executables\&.
  dos        \- Always convert leading spaces and trailing dots and spaces to
               characters in the UNICODE private use area\&.  This allows to use
               broken filesystems which only allow DOS filenames, even if they
               are not recognized as such by Cygwin\&.
  exec       \- Treat all files below mount point as executable\&.
  ihash      \- Always fake inode numbers rather than using the ones returned
               by the filesystem\&.  This allows to use broken filesystems which
               don\*(Aqt return unambiguous inode numbers, even if they are not
               recognized as such by Cygwin\&.
  noacl      \- Ignore ACLs and fake POSIX permissions\&.
  nosuid     \- No suid files are allowed (currently unimplemented)
  notexec    \- Treat all files below mount point as not executable\&.
  override   \- Override immutable mount points\&.
  posix=0    \- Switch off case sensitivity for paths under this mount point\&.
  posix=1    \- Switch on case sensitivity for paths under this mount point
               (default)\&.
  sparse     \- Switch on support for sparse files\&.  This option only makes
               sense on NTFS and then only if you really need sparse files\&.
	       This flag is always silently enabled on SSD drives\&.
  text       \- Files default to CRLF text mode line endings\&.

.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
For a more complete description of the mount options and the
/etc/fstab
file, see
the section called \(lqThe Cygwin Mount Table\(rq\&.
.PP
Note that all mount points added with
\fBmount\fR
are user mount points\&. System mount points can only be specified in the
/etc/fstab
file\&.
.PP
If you added mount points to
/etc/fstab
or your
/etc/fstab\&.d/<username>
file, you can add these mount points to your current user session using the
\-a/\-\-all
option, or by specifing the posix path alone on the command line\&. As an example, consider you added a mount point with the POSIX path
/my/mount\&. You can add this mount point with either one of the following two commands to your current user session\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBmount /my/mount\fR
$ \fBmount \-a\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The first command just adds the
/my/mount
mount point to your current session, the
\fBmount \-a\fR
adds all new mount points to your user session\&.
.PP
If you change a mount point to point to another native path, or if you changed the flags of a mount point, you have to
\fBumount\fR
the mount point first, before you can add it again\&. Please note that all such added mount points are added as user mount points, and that the rule that system mount points can\*(Aqt be removed or replaced in a running session still applies\&.
.PP
To bind a POSIX path to another POSIX path, use the
bind
mount flag\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBmount \-o bind /var /usr/var\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This command makes the file hirarchy under
/var
additionally available under
/usr/var\&.
.PP
The
\-m
option causes the
\fBmount\fR
utility to output the current mount table in a series of fstab entries\&. You can save this output as a backup when experimenting with the mount table\&. Copy the output to
/etc/fstab
to restore the old state\&. It also makes moving your settings to a different machine much easier\&.
.SS "Cygdrive mount points"
.PP
Whenever Cygwin cannot use any of the existing mounts to convert from a particular Win32 path to a POSIX one, Cygwin will, instead, convert to a POSIX path using a default mount point:
/cygdrive\&. For example, if Cygwin accesses
z:\efoo
and the z drive is not currently in the mount table, then
z:\e
will be accessible as
/cygdrive/z\&. The
\fBmount\fR
utility can be used to change this default automount prefix through the use of the "\-\-change\-cygdrive\-prefix" option\&. In the following example, we will set the automount prefix to
/mnt:
.PP
\fBExample\ \&3.12.\ \&Changing the default prefix\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBmount \-\-change\-cygdrive\-prefix /mnt\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that the cygdrive prefix can be set both per\-user and system\-wide, and that as with all mounts, a user\-specific mount takes precedence over the system\-wide setting\&. The
\fBmount\fR
utility creates system\-wide mounts by default if you do not specify a type\&. You can always see the user and system cygdrive prefixes with the
\-p
option\&. Using the
\-\-options
flag with
\-\-change\-cygdrive\-prefix
makes all new automounted filesystems default to this set of options\&. For instance (using the short form of the command line flags)
.PP
\fBExample\ \&3.13.\ \&Changing the default prefix with specific mount options\fR
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ \fBmount \-c /mnt \-o binary,noacl\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Limitations"
.PP
Limitations: there is a hard\-coded limit of 64 mount points\&. Also, although you can mount to pathnames that do not start with "/", there is no way to make use of such mount points\&.
.PP
Normally the POSIX mount point in Cygwin is an existing empty directory, as in standard UNIX\&. If this is the case, or if there is a place\-holder for the mount point (such as a file, a symbolic link pointing anywhere, or a non\-empty directory), you will get the expected behavior\&. Files present in a mount point directory before the mount become invisible to Cygwin programs\&.
.PP
It is sometimes desirable to mount to a non\-existent directory, for example to avoid cluttering the root directory with names such as
a,
b,
c
pointing to disks\&. Although
\fBmount\fR
will give you a warning, most everything will work properly when you refer to the mount point explicitly\&. Some strange effects can occur however\&. For example if your current working directory is
/dir, say, and
/dir/mtpt
is a mount point, then
mtpt
will not show up in an
\fBls\fR
or
\fBecho *\fR
command and
\fBfind \&.\fR
will not find
mtpt\&.
