.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBdumper\fR
utility can be used to create a core dump of running Windows process\&. This core dump can be later loaded into
\fBgdb\fR
and analyzed\&.
.PP
If the core file size limit is set to unlimited (e\&.g\&.
\fBulimit \-c unlimited\fR) and an
error_start
executable hasn\*(Aqt been configured in the
CYGWIN
environment variable, Cygwin will automatically run
\fBdumper\fR
when a fatal error occurs\&.
.PP
\fBdumper\fR
can be also be started from the command line to create a core dump of any running process\&.
.PP
For historical reasons, unless the
\-n
option is given, after the core dump is created and when the
\fBdumper\fR
exits, the target process is also terminated\&.
.PP
To save space in the core dump,
\fBdumper\fR
doesn\*(Aqt write those portions of the target process\*(Aqs memory space that were loaded from executable and dll files and are unchanged (e\&.g\&. program code)\&. Instead,
\fBdumper\fR
saves paths to the files which contain that data\&. When a core dump is loaded into gdb, it uses these paths to load the appropriate files\&. That means that if you create a core dump on one machine and try to debug it on another, you\*(Aqll need to place identical copies of the executable and dlls in the same directories as on the machine where the core dump was created\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
A Cygwin "core dump file" is an ELF file containing the mutable parts of the process memory and special note sections which capture the process, thread and loaded module context needed to recreate the process image in a debugger\&.
